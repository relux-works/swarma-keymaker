# Decisions and unresolved questions

The authoritative decision list and safe defaults are in
[`spec/keymaker.md`, section 14](spec/keymaker.md#14-open-questions-and-activation-gates).

- Q1 and Q4: helper ownership split and module naming — decided.
- Q2 and Q3: deferred decrypt and interim administrator authority — pending curator ruling.
- Q6–Q7: generation adapter/retirement ordering and signed operator-record
  verification — activation gates.
- Q8–Q11: name-index approval, control-group provisioning, external root
  attestation/rotation and the reusable Linux test window — qualification gates.
- Q12: executable-qualified enrollment is valid data but not an available v0
  enforcement capability. All matched rows with `exe` refuse locally, including
  matching procfs snapshots. No UID-only fallback is allowed.

## Q5: registrar draft alignment and explicit differences

Reference: [swarma-registrar spec/registrar.md (draft)](https://github.com/relux-works/swarma-registrar/blob/15b2604a9c8827c6f64365c15b45d0d933a08a1b/spec/registrar.md),
sections 2–5. Its constants remain under review; a changed revision requires
explicit consumer updates and re-qualification before activation.

| Conflict or dependency | Disposition / remaining gate |
| --- | --- |
| Earlier Keymaker fixtures represented uid_map as a UID-keyed object; registrar requires an array of integer-UID rows with names and optional exe | Corrected to the registrar schema; existing vector IDs retained. Array-valued mutations remain one changed field. |
| Earlier localpart proposal allowed slash and ignored the configured-audience mxid bound | Withdrawn; use registrar structured/explicit-legacy rules and its 255-byte mxid bound. Negative slash and length-bound cases added. |
| Earlier encoding details were assumptions | Body construction, Ed25519 encoding, envelope/signature/nonce, time and half-open key windows now reference the draft owner sections instead of duplicating their schema. |
| Native helper requires canonical frame bytes; registrar HTTP accepts noncanonical JSON wire spellings | Intentional transport distinction. The same semantic body uses the same CCJ-1 scalar-order codec and canonical signature preimage. Do not relax native frames or reject registrar HTTP whitespace by analogy. |
| Draft requires an additional offline enrollment-publisher pin and whole-history rollback checks | Keymaker must use the same approved pin and verification rule; publisher authority remains a registrar draft proposal awaiting content approval. No owner-device signature is inferred from it. |
| A retained native helper response may contain a nonce already consumed by registrar HTTP admission | Same-ID helper retry retrieves evidence, not another HTTP success. A fresh admission uses a new native ID and independent nonce; joint retry tests remain a gate. |
| Registrar accepts syntactically valid executable-qualified rows; v0 cannot attest per-operation executable identity | Explicit local capability refusal `enrollment_unsupported`, not a registrar format change. Wrong, unavailable and matching executable snapshots all refuse. Future enablement is Q12. |
| Enrollment maps UIDs, while local custody also needs binding/generation evidence | Active station binding and protected per-UID generation admission remain additional local checks; no extra enrollment wire member is invented. Joint revocation/re-admission tests remain required. |

The helper's wrapper and local refusal codes remain Keymaker-owned; registrar
loader diagnostics are not silently renamed into signed-format rules. The
helper is Ed25519-only in v0 although the registrar also supports P-256.
No unresolved interface may be replaced with an allow-all production stub.
